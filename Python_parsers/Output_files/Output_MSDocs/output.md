UNITED STATES v. CAUSBY ET UX.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 630. Argued May 1, 1946 .- Decided May 27, 1946.
Respondents owned a dwelling and a chicken farm near a municipal
airport. The safe path of glide to one of the runways of the airport
passed directly over respondents' property at 83 feet, which was 67
feet above the house, 63 feet above the barn and 18 feet above the
highest tree. It was used 4% of the time in taking off and 7% of
the time in landing. The Government leased the use of the airport
(
for a term of one month commencing June 1, 1942, with a provision
for renewals until June 30, 1967, or six months after the end of the
national emergency, whichever was earlier. Various military air-
craft of the United States used the airport. They frequently came
so close to respondents' property that they barely missed the tops
of trees, the noise was startling, and the glare from their landing
.. lights lighted the place up brightly at night. This destroyed the
use of the property as a chicken farm and caused loss of sleep,
nervousness and fright on the part of respondents. They sued in
:
the' Court of Claims to recover for an alleged taking of their prop-
'erty and for damages to their poultry business. The Court of
Claims found that the Government had taken an easement over
w ; respondents' property and that the value of the property destroyed
and the easement taken was $2,000; but it made no finding as to
the precise nature or duration of the easement. Held :
1. A servitude has been imposed upon the land for which respond-
ents are entitled to compensation under the. Fifth Amendment.
Pp. 260-267.
(a) The common law doctrine that ownership of land extends
to the periphery of the universe has no place in the modern world.
Pp. 260, 261.
(b) The air above the minimum safe altitude of flight pre-
scribed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority is a public highway and
part of the public domain, as declared by Congress in the Air Com-
merce Act of 1926, as amended by the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938.
Pp. 260, 261, 266.
(c) Flights below that altitude are not within the navigable air
space which Congress placed within the public domain, even though
they are within the path of glide approved by the Civil Aeronautics
Authority. Pp. 263, 264.

(d) Flights of aircraft over private land which are so low and
frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the
enjoyment and use of the land are as much' an appropriation of
the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it. Pp.
261, 262, 264-267.
2. Since there was a taking of private property for public use,
the claim was "founded upon the Constitution," within the meaning
of § 141 (1) of the Judicial Code, and the Court of Claims had juris-
diction to hear and determine it. P. 267.
3. Since the court's findings of fact contain no precise description
of the nature or duration of the easement taken, the judgment is
reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Claims, so that
it may make the necessary findings. Pp. 267, 268.
(a) An accurate description of the easement taken is essential,
since that interest vests in the United States. P. 267.
(b) Findings of fact on every "material issue" are a statutory
requirement, and a deficiency in the findings can not be rectified by
statements in the opinion. Pp. 267, 268.
(c) A conjecture in lieu of a conclusion from evidence would
not be a proper foundation for liability of the United States.
· P. 268.
104 Ct. Cls. 342, 60 F. Supp. 751, reversed and remanded.
The Court of Claims granted respondents a judgment
for the value of property destroyed and damage to their
property resulting from the taking of an easement over
their property by low-flying military aircraft of the United
States, but failed to include in its findings of fact a specific
description of the nature or duration of the easement.
104 Ct. Cls. 342, 60 F. Supp. 751. This Court granted
certiorari. 327 U. S. 775. Reversed and remanded,
p. 268.
